- [I made a thing](https://clayxdefibs.darrelltaylor.dev/).  Simple map that pulls in defibrillator locations form [OpenStreenMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) via [overpass-turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) and presents them on a map, showing the nearest to you with an option to show directions.
